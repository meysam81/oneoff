  lastUpdated="2025-01-15"
>
  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    OneOff is a self-hosted, open-source job scheduler. This Privacy Policy explains what data
    is collected and how it is handled, both by the Software itself and by this website.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Self-Hosted Software — No Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    OneOff is designed to be fully self-hosted. When you run OneOff on your own infrastructure:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>We collect no data</strong> from your OneOff instance</li>
    <li>All data (jobs, executions, configurations) remains on your servers</li>
    <li>There are no telemetry, analytics, or "phone home" features</li>
    <li>The Software does not communicate with any external servers operated by OneOff maintainers</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Your data is entirely under your control. We have no access to your scheduled jobs, execution
    logs, or any other information stored in your OneOff instance.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Landing Page (tryoneoff.com)</h2>
  <p>
    This website (tryoneoff.com) is a static site that provides information about OneOff and
    hosts the community template catalog.
  </p>

  <h3>3.1 No Cookies</h3>
  <p>
    This website does not use cookies for tracking or analytics purposes. No personal data is
    stored in your browser.

  <h3>3.2 Server Logs</h3>
  <p>
    Like most websites, our hosting provider may collect standard server logs that include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>IP addresses</li>
    <li>Browser type and version</li>
    <li>Pages visited and timestamps</li>
    <li>Referring URLs</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These logs are used solely for security monitoring and troubleshooting, not for tracking
    individual users or building profiles.
  </p>

    This website contains links to GitHub (github.com) for:
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li>Contributor profiles in the template catalog</li>
  </ul>

    </a>
    applies. We have no control over GitHub's data collection practices.
  </p>
